## Objective

To predict the price of Airbnb listings in major U.S. cities.

## Steps Followed

1. Understood the problem statement and data.

2. Performed data pre-processing on the data to generate more accurate or better insights from the data:
  a. Null value detection
  b. Null value treatment
  c. Feature Engineering i.e. creating new variables, transforming some of the existing variables and removing some variables.
  d. Correlation matrix
  e. Calculating Feature Importance score for all the variables using Extra Tree Regressor.
  f. Making columns equal for train and test set.
  g. Creating dummy variables for categorical variables.
  h. Splitting the train set into train and validate.

3. Data Visualisation using Python and Tableau

4. Built different regression models on the data.

5. Calculated Performance metrics for various models using RMSE and compared the results to find the best model built.

6. Used the best fit model to predict for the “log_price” variable for the test dataset.
